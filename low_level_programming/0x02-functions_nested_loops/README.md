# Functions, nested loops

### Tasks ðŸ“‹

**0.\_putchar**

- Write a program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.

**2.10x alphabet**

- Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
  - Prototype: `void print_alphabet_x10(void)`
  - You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code.

**3.islower**

- Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
  - Prototype: `int _islower(int c);`
  - Returnn `1` if `c` is lowercase
  - Return `0` otherwise.

**8. Jack Bauer**

- Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from `00:00` to `23:59`.
- Prototype: `void jack_bauer(void);`

**11. 98 Battery Street, the OG**

- Write a function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line.
  - Prototype: `void print_to_98(int n);`
  - Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by space.
  - Numbers should be printed in order
  - The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
  - The last printed number should be 98

**13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women**

- If we list all the natural numbers below `10` that are multiples of `3` or `5`, we get `3`, `5`, `6` and `9`. The sum of these multiples is `23`.
  Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded), followed by a new line.
