# FCC Palindrome Checker Project

Palindrome checker is one of the required projects for FCC's JavaScript Algorithms and DataStructures Certificate.

Students are asked built an application that checks whether a given word is a palindrome.

> A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to [freeCodeCamp's version](https://palindrome-checker.freecodecamp.rocks/)
