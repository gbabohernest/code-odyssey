# Task Manager API  

A basic REST API built with Express.js for learning purposes. It performs CRUD operations on MongoDB data with basic validation and error checking using  a custom error middleware.  


## Setup  

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Set up your environment variables in a `.env.development.local` file.  
   - You can change the filename in `/config/env.js`.  
   - Update your MongoDB URL accordingly.  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
        npm install
   ```

4. Run the API
    ```bash
    npm run dev  #OR 
    npm app.js
    ```

5. Test the endpoints using Postman or any API testing tool.


Thanks!!
